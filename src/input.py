#dump data into c file, float array
#time the program
#make timer for seconds, vec, vec_num+time_size=vec_len, bin size
#2 secs of data=lots of samples, split that into 2^8 vectors, get the closest amount of samples to 2 seconds that divides evenly into 256
#constant of 2 secs
#secure folder, pick one of the immediate ones, conversation/music/cooking audio


#use norm/other python script to extract bits
#use the output of that to pipe it into a c file
